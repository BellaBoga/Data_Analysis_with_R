– To what extent is the used corpus representative for language
production? Scrutinize the corpus set up!

>>Not really representative, as the set up 
>>was pretty 
>>artificial("Disfluencies
>>and mispronunciations were avoided by 
>>requiring speakers to
>>repeat errorful utterances"(Aylett,3051))


– Aylett and Turk excluded vowels from their analysis. What effects
could this have on the results and interpretation?

>>This could have led to inaccuracies in the 
>>interpretation of the scrutinised data. 


– Search for an article regarding the relation between vowel duration
and vowel frequency! How does this relate to the present results?

– What are unigrams, bigrams and trigrams?

>>Unigrams, bigrams and trigrams are the 
>>likelihood of a syllable without context
>>(unigram), given the previous syllable
>>(bigram) and given the previous two syllables
>>(trigrams).
>>A log transformation was applied to
>>these likelihoods in order to relate the 
>>values more closely to
>>information content ͑Pierce, 1961͒ and to 
>>normalize the dis-
>>tributions. In order to calculate these 
>>likelihoods, the CMU
>>language toolkit ͑Clarkson and Rosenfeld, >>1997͒ was used to
>>compute n-gram statistics based on the 
>>syllabic transcriptions
>>of 187 million words found in news resources 
>>on the Inter-
>>net. Transcriptions were automatically 
>>generated using the
>>Rhetorical Systems speech synthesizer.

– How could you calculate probability given the context?

>> I don't really understand the question...

– What problems could there be with the authors assessment of phrasal
stress and phrasal boundaries for their prosodic model?

>>They didn't take several distinctions into 
>>account, such as accent type, boundary tone 
>>type, phrase type and distinctions between 
>>unstressed syllables and those that could
>>bear secondary lexical stress.
