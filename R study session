discrimination is when you discriminate

learning theory(Pavlov theory, takes the cues and outcomes and uses it in discrimination) and activation(the total support that th) are part of the discrimination theory


discriminative learning basically means that by experience you can discriminate outcomes by given cues



perception with learning theory and production with the Rescorla Wagner Model

activation is when we try to link the cues to the outcomes and there is different activation weights depending on the different choices/nodes you have --> it is a relly
in order to be able to discriminate you should make the activation work
in order to discriminate the cues we need an activation
