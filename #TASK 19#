#TASK 19#
#-------#
#1) Please add a bigram column to "DFbig". In a sequence of ABC (I love R) take into a
#ccount bigrams with the pattern AB (I love) and
#bigrams with the pattern BC (love R) for the target word B, i.e. love.

#2) Please add bigram counts to "DFbig" for both patterns, AB and BC. 

# facultative 3): If you feel very bored during the vacations and have nothing to do, 
#you could calculate the durations for the bigrams and include them into the dataframe "DFbig".
