The general aims of the paper could be supported by significant effect of language redundancy on F1/F2 formant values. Furthermore evidence was found for the smooth signal redundancy hypothesis as in overlap in effects of redundancy and prosodic prominence.
Nevertheless the effects were influenced by vowel variation. Aylett and Turk also mention some improvements that could be made such as adding secondary lexcical stress, degrees of variation in phrasal stress, accent type differentiation based on f0 contours and interaction between prominence and prosodic boundaries to the prosodic model. Yet it is not clear which model would be most appropriate for modelling acoustic redundancy.
